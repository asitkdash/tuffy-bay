make sure to import "tuffy-bay.sql" file before using website locally

TODO: 
1. searching algorithm needs to be improved (not just exact keyword searching), tuffy_inventory->search_item() in functions.php
5. certain things can be done through javascript rather than php, like the admin_add_items.php page
6. there's currently no error display if an admin adds a new item and the name is already taken (SQL is setup to not allow it)
8. automatic capitalization is happening in account.php
11. increase size for description on items 



admin account: 
username: admin_user
